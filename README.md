# materialdesign-webpack-boilerplate
Boilerplate code for starting a new Material Design based project with WebPack.

Based on Google's fantastic Getting Started guide over at [material.io](https://material.io/develop/web/docs/getting-started/).

## Usage
`npm run build` will use webpack to build `bundle.css` and `bundle.js` in the root directory.

`npm start` or `npm run start` will build the code through webpack-dev-server and hosts the app on `http://localhost:8080`
